# Performance Evaluation of Marketing Campaigns to Support Acquisition Growth

## Project Overview
This project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of multiple marketing campaigns by analyzing customer responses, conversion behavior, and key factors influencing campaign performance. Python was used for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), while Excel supported further business-focused analysis. All findings are consolidated into a professionally structured PDF report.
## Objectives
- Identify high-performing marketing campaigns in terms of both conversion outcomes and cost efficiency.
- Understand key factors that influence customer conversion across different campaigns.
- Provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to improve future campaign effectiveness and optimize marketing resource allocation.
## Methodology
**Python (EDA and Preprocessing)**
- Missing value checks and data quality validation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis to assess distributions and identify outliers.

**Excel (Business Analysis)**
- Pivot table creation and summary metrics.
- Conversion rate calculations.
- Performance comparisons across channels and campaigns.
## Key Findings
- Customers who received campaigns were identified as high-value customers. Although overall conversion rates remained below 10 percent, their average spending reached approximately USD 1,000, indicating strong purchasing power.
- Campaign 5 demonstrated the highest effectiveness and efficiency, achieving the strongest revenue-to-cost ratio of USD 86,670 and the lowest cost per conversion at USD 0.001. Campaigns 1 and 4 followed with ratios of USD 70,259 and USD 62,187, respectively.
- Customers aged 50 and above showed the highest responsiveness across all campaigns. Campaigns 2 and 4 recorded conversion rates of 63 percent and 64 percent within this age group. In contrast, customers under 30 were the least responsive segment, with conversion rates below 10 percent.
